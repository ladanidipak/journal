The blending ratio of butanol to diesel was varied from 0 to 40 vol% using an increment of 10 vol%, and each blend was tested on a diesel engine equipped with an EGR system. The test was carried out fewer than two engine loads at a constant engine speed, using various combinations of EGR ratios and injection timings. Test results indicate that butanol addition to engine fuel is able to substantially decrease soot emission from raw exhaust gas, while the change in NOx emissions varies depending on the butanol content and engine operating conditions. Increasing EGR ratio and retarding injection timing are effective approaches to reduce NOx emissions from combustion of butanol-diesel blends. But the engine control strategies need to be optimized in order to achieve low levels of both soot and NOx emissions, as well as a reasonable fuel economy.', '', 'NIRAJ R. SHINGALA', 'V.V.P.

Hert’z Contact sress theory for line contact, L10 life equation, Static Load Distribution.', 'The optimum selection of a bearing generally depends on particular application such as to transfer loads between the rotating and stationary members, and to permit free rotation. From among the wide range of bearings available in the market today has various considerations, such as the load-carrying capacity, the life of the bearing, and the working rotational speed need to be considered before a suitable bearing can be selected. Here for this synchromesh gear box system needle roller bearing is used. So, all the required data for the required calculations are given by the KCI INDUSTRIES (INDIA) LTD. With the help of Hert’z Contact Stress theory (for Line Contact due to the use of Needle Roller Bearing) by using the maximum value of load for the roller at zero position, we find the value of contact width, maximum bearing pressure, principle stresses and Von mises stress for each particular bearing which is used for particular gear pair of synchromesh gear box.In this case after doing the contact stress analysis through analytical method, we can conclude that if we change the value of L10 life(in hours) from the theorical value of L10 life(in hours), there is no need to change the bearing whether there is high value of load on the needle roller bearing then the theorical value of load. A proper understanding of the mechanism of contact between two or more surfaces is crucial in the design process of many devices. Analytical and computational methods are useful for knowing the characteristics at the contact interface in order to properly understand geometry and its effect on surface properties. The surface was simplified so that Hertz theory could be used to model surface deformation and resulting contact stresses. From this contact stress analysis in future, selection of bearing is done by the calculation of the induced stress like von-misses and shear stress, also by increasing the load carrying capacity and also increasing the contact area, max and average compressive stress, max deflection, and max shear stress along with its location with the help of Hertzian contact stress theory.', '', 'Mr. Pankit B.

With its unique capability to control simultaneously real and reactive power flows on a transmission line as well as to regulate voltage at the bus where it is connected, this device creates a tremendous quality impact on power system stability. These features become even more significant knowing that the UPFC can allow loading of the transmission lines close to their thermal limits, forcing the power to flow through the desired paths. This will give the power system operators much needed flexibility in order to satisfy the demands that the deregulated power system will impose.\r\nIn this thesis the performance of UPFC is investigated in controlling the flow of power over the transmission line. This research deals with simulation of 6-bus power system using UPFC to improve the power transfer capability through a transmission line by placing UPFC at the sending end using computer simulation. When no UPFC is installed, real power, reactive power and voltage through the transmission line cannot be controlled. The circuit model for UPFC is developed using rectifier and inverter circuits. The MATLAB® simulation results are presented to validate the model. The results of network with and without using UPFC are compared in terms of active power flow and reactive power flow in the line. Also IEEE 14 bus system is implemented in PSAT so that when UPFC is connected to   the weak bus then it increases the voltage stability of the weak bus.\r\n', '', 'Prof. Nilkanth A Patel ', 'ipcowala institute of engineering and technology, dharamaj', 'nilkanth.eee@gmail.com', '9898796964', 'ipcowala institute of engineering and technology', 'amrapali township dharamaj', 'anand', '388430', 'gujarat', 'India', 'GRDJE/V01/I01/0009/1450676463_nilkanth-sir-review-paper.docx', '{"Title construction of manuscript was good":"Fully Agree","Introduction covers each part of work done area Introduction covers all required thorough":"Agree","Knowledge to understand the topic":"Agree","Material method was given with company detail":"Agree","All materials were covered which was used in that work":"Agree","Method was describe in details":"Agree","Method was describe with quantity of materials used in that work":"Agree","Result was discussed thoroughly to understand the effect of work":"Agree","Result was discussed with mathematical model Application":"Agree","Acknowledgement was described all help which was received during the work":"Partial Agree","I do not have any objection if this work was published in this journal":"Fully Agree","comment":"Article is acceptable....\\r\\n"}', 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', NULL, 6, 'GRDJE/V01/I01/0009/', '1', 0, 0, 0, '2015-12-21 11:11:04', 0, '2015-12-23 22:19:58', 1, 0),

There are two underlying motivations for us to write this survey paper: the first is to provide an up-to-date review of the existing literature, and the second is to offer some insights into the studies of machine recognition of faces. There are many methods exist to perform face detection, on this, Some use flesh tones, some use contours, and other are even more complex involving templates, neural networks, or filters. This all methods generally utilizes 2D images for feature extraction and matching. Nowadays some of the algorithms make use of 3D images for the same. It will give more accurate and higher resilience towards covariates, such as expression, illumination and pose variations. But it is challenging because of the high cost of 3D sensors. RGB-D face recognition is introduced to reduce this problem of high cost of 3D sensors, which makes use of the features of both original image and depth image for the face recognition. This survey focuses on different 2D or 3D or combination of both face recognition techniques under different covariates, such as illuminations, expressions, noise, disguised conditions and different pose variations.', '', 'Jesny Antony', 'Federal Institute of Science and Technology', 'jesnyantony@gmail.com', '9495341668', 'Karippai house', 'Kuttikad P.O.', 'Chalakudy', '680724', 'Kerala', 'India', 'GRDJE/V01/I02/0007/1453736692_jesnyface-recogntion-paper.doc', '{"Title construction of manuscript was good":"Agree","Introduction covers each part of work done area Introduction covers all required thorough":"Agree","Knowledge to understand the topic":"Partial Agree","Material method was given with company detail":"Agree","All materials were covered which was used in that work":"Agree","Method was describe in details":"Partial Agree","Method was describe with quantity of materials used in that work":"Agree","Result was discussed thoroughly to understand the effect of work":"Partial Agree","Result was discussed with mathematical model Application":"Partial Agree","Acknowledgement was described all help which was received during the work":"Agree","I do not have any objection if this work was published in this journal":"Agree","comment":"Dear Author..\\r\\n \\r\\n1) I appreciate your work. \\r\\n2) The methodology needs clarity explanation with sample data, \\r\\n3) Technological Development in Face Recognition and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) analysis, RGB-D Based face Recognition are expecting the diagrams.\\r\\n4) Your paper concept are match the following domain papers: arxiv.org (2 matches); citeseerx.ist.psu.edu (2 matches); umiacs.umd.edu (1 matches); researchgate.net (1 matches); dl.acm.org (1 matches); cfar.umd.edu (1 matches); scirate.com (1 matches); jgrcs.info (1 matches);\\r\\n5) There was clear scientific and practicality to support the recommendation for 73%.\\r\\n"}', 0, 'GRDJE/V01/I02/0007/1454562606_jesn-new.docx', 'GRDJE/V01/I02/0007/1454562606_jesn-new.docx', 0, 3, 'GRDJE/V01/I02/0007/Formatted_File_2016_02_04_21_44_47.docx', NULL, 15, 'GRDJE/V01/I02/0007/', '3', 0, 0, 0, '2016-01-25 21:14:53', 0, '2016-02-04 21:44:48', 0, 0),

Magneto Rheological is a branch of rheology that deals with the flow and deformation of the materials under an applied magnetic field. These types of materials change their rheological properties under the application of magnetic field applied and turn from liquid to solid in just few seconds. MR fluid is the colloidal suspension of micron sized, polarizable magnetic particles (iron metal particle) in the magnetically neutral carrier fluid (low viscosity paraffin oil / silicon oil) whose viscosity can be varied from liquid to semisolid with the help of magnetic field. \r\n                Magneto rheological (MR) fluid technology has been proven for many industrial applications like shock absorbers, actuators, seat dampers, etc..

In view of this, extensive research work is taking place world-wide in the area of on-line tool condition monitoring system. Tool wear is the most undesirable characteristic of machining processes as it adversely affects the tool life, which is of foremost importance in metal cutting owing to its direct impact on the surface quality of the machined surface, and its dimensional accuracy, and consequently, the economics of machining operations.Tool wear has negative effects on surface quality, dimensional precision of work piece, and may even cause a harmful effect on safe operation of total machining system. According to the research, about 20% machine downtime is caused by the tool wear.In addition, the cost of cutting tool and tool changing is about 3–12% of the total machining cost and method for on-machine tool progressive monitoring of tool flank wear by processing the turned component. Therefore, methods for cutting tool wearin an over view of the maximum use of cutting tools. With an effective monitoring system, the wear and damages to the machine tool, downtime, lead time and scrapped components can be avoided.

Two different motion planning approaches have been proposed to solve the said problem. In Approach 1, automatic design of a Mamdani-type Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) using a binary-coded Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been considered. On the other hand, a potential field- based motion planner has been developed in the next approach. Since, the robots are agents and all the time competition is not good, a strategic approach has been proposed to solve the conflicts related to coordination among agents. Performance of the developed approaches have been tested through computer simulations. Computational complexity of both the approaches are also compared to see the feasibility of their on-line implementations. It has been observed that proposed coordination strategy along with the developed motion planners are found to generate movement of the robots in a human-like manner.', '[1]	Alami, R., Chatila, R., Fleury, S. and Ingrand, F.

The Google Earth Image of Surat City is downloaded and the elevation of node, length of pipe was recorded for nearly 214 junctions and 293 pipes. These data was used in EPANET software for analysis of pressure, head loss and elevation. This analysis resulted in pressure and elevation at various nodes and head loss at various pipes.

One of a solution to this situation is to convert the left-over (vacant) spaces into a park. It will increase the physical as well as recreation activities in the urban settlement. One of the primary criteria for the parks is to have them within a walkable distance. Such parks can be of two kinds: playgrounds and community gardens. These also can be named as mini-parks and for developing such parks serving a common interest, an active support is required from within the Commonwealth and the Government. These small places or mini parks can serve a dual purpose such as recreation as well as the generation of economic activity to a smaller extent. The paper discusses over health aspects in an urban area for the citizens followed by basics of and some of the cases related to novel efforts in developing mini-parks. The cases discussed are of (A) Paley Park, NY-USA, (B) Mini-park in Higashi-Ikebukuro of Tokyo and (C) Ghost train park of Lima. Authors attempt for a comparative analysis of these three parks. Discussion follows a proposal of developing a recently closed down project of Sky-bus in Goa as a mini-park.

Less area, more speed, and less power consumption are the main constraints of today’s technology. These constraints kept in mind in this proposed project to design such a BIST circuit, which will provide the efficient output.', '', 'Ritu Singh Thakur', 'Dr. C. V.

M2M communication is nothing but machine communicates with each other. In our project, one machine acts as a server aka managing node (MN) and another acts as a client aka controller node(CN).They can send and receive data in each other. We are using 2 Raspberry pi B+ as client and server. Raspberry pi has more important features,  So we are using it.\r\nTo have the faster communication between these we use PowerLink protocol stack. It helps in transmission of time critical data. It is faster than Ethernet. These solutions are commonly referred to as “real-time industrial Ethernet” technologies. POWERLINK has become one of the most successful real-time industrial Ethernet systems. PowerLink technology is easily ported on any embedded device .It provides high speed data transfer,   ease of installation  .\r\n\r\nFuture scope- In today’s world Shop floor management is one of the most important ongoing activities performed in every Industry. On each shop floor there are few tens to thousands of machines having different parameters those impact production, machine health, performance, quality, etc. In a typical scenario, the data is manually collected in the form of reports in predetermined time. This reports are then used for analysis. There are many chances for inaccuracies into a manual data collection system. Firstly the data must be first written down, and later entered into the system sometimes by a different person than the one that recorded it in the first place. Whenever a human operator enters data, he or she has influence over exactly what information is entered and when it is entered. \r\nM2M Communication provides complete visibility of all the manufacturing work order activity. It can extend across different fields to track product activities from raw materials to finished goods. The outcome of this project is to make the shop floor intelligent. M2M Communication has a powerful reporting feature that allows you to configure and generate reports on demand, or it is also used to set up schedules to automatically deliver pre-configured reports. The M2M Communication Standard Reports are labels that can be configured to include data from a specified time period, also from specific machines, operators, part numbers or other parameters depending on machine type. \r\nIt helps to give precise and unbiased results to the top management. So it helps the top management to keep track of ongoing activities of the shop floor. The result should be a less communication gap between top management and the shop floor.

In this paper, we use AB (Attribute Based) algorithm to check the files based on their attribute so it requires less time for checking all those files. After finishing this process it will check the content of the particular file, then the files having the same content re identified to be duplicated and will be eliminated, which will be more efficient.', '', 'M.

The different active and passive methods are used for the same. One of the passive technique is use of dimples. A depression forming recesses on a flat surface is considered as a dimple. Variation in dimple geometry results in various heat transfer and friction characteristics. Introducing the dimples on the surface not only increases the surface area available for heat transfer but also reduce the hydrodynamic resistance for the fluid flow over the surface, resulting in less pressure drop. The present work is based on experimental investigation of the forced convection heat transfer over the V-shaped dimpled surface. The experiments were performed on 150mm × 150mm × 15mm aluminium plate with V- shaped dimples with pitch 3.2D, where D = diameter of dimple. V-dimples with  δ/D = 0.2, 0.3, 0.5 are investigated, where δ= dimple depth. The experimentation was carried over a rectangular duct with aspect ratio 3:2. Heat transfer coefficient, Nusselt Number, friction factor and overall thermal performance of dimpled surface are compared with those from flat surface under same conditions. It is found that dimpled surface show 30- 45% enhancement over a flat plate. The maximum enhancement is observed in δ=0.3D in inline pattern. The dimpled surface with δ=0.5D shows minimum enhancement. Maximum frictional losses are observed in δ=0.5D dimpled surface and minimum in δ=0.2D dimpled surface. The overall thermal efficiency goes on increasing with increasing Reynolds number for all cases. The enhancement was verified using CFD analysis using ANSYSIS-15 ICEM software using k-ε turbulence model.\r\n', '', 'Amit Ranaware', 'PES’s Modern College of Engineering, Pune, India', 'ranawareamit@yahoo.co.in', '9767215821', 's.no.114/1, plot no.32,33, Chandan Appartment, Near chavan chaul,', 'Vishranwadi', 'PUNE', '411015', 'Maharashtra', 'India', 'GRDJE/V01/I04/0112/1458887166_FINAL-PAPER-A.G.-Ranaware.docx', '', 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', NULL, 1, 'GRDJE/V01/I04/0112/', '3', 1, 1, 0, '2016-03-25 11:56:07', 0, '2016-03-27 22:36:46', 1, 0),

In Indian middle class and poor families cannot afford all types of refrigeration system like a ac, refrigerator, air cooler, etc. generally they purchase only air cooler. To solve this we can integrate refrigeration system of ac, refrigerator and air cooler in one product. So, that it cans multiplication and can we say as multifunctional refrigeration system. This type’s product various components are used like as compressor, condenser, capillary tube, evaporator, motor, fan, etc. ', '', 'SHASHANK KISHOR CHAURAGADE', 'DBACER, NAGPUR', 'shashankchauragade@gmail.com', '7756827395', 'AT.

Before the tree construction initiates, every processor must sort the items according to their support count. The master processor gathers all local counts to be summed together and ultimately form a global support count to be broadcasted to all processors in the group. Items having support count less than the minimum threshold are removed from the process in slave node as well as master node. The next step is the FP-tree construction in which each node scans and sends the transaction according to threshold. At the same time master node, make its tree and also updated the tree as items come from slave node. This project provides an insight into the usage of Message Passing Interface for clustering of system. MPI has been used here in distributed environment.

Bank customers may access their funds and perform other simple transactions from any of the member branch offices. The major issue in core banking is the authenticity of the customer. Due to unavoidable hacking of the databases on the internet, it is always quite difficult to trust the information on the internet. To solve this problem of authentication, we are proposing an algorithm based on image processing and visual cryptography.This paper proposes a technique of processing the secret key of a customer and then dividing it into shares. Total number of shares to be created is depending on the scheme chosen by the bank. When two shares are created, one is stored in the Bank database and the other is kept by the customer or send to image server. The customer has to present the share during all of his transactions. This share is stacked with the first share to get the original Transaction key. The Correlation method is used to take the decision on acceptance or rejection of the output and authenticate the customer.', '', 'Ritesh kumar', 'Rajiv Gandhi college of Engg.

Nevertheless, since the outsourced cloud storage service is not fully trustworthy, it raises security concerns on how to realize data de-duplication in cloud while achieving integrity auditing. In this work, we study the problem of secure de-duplication on cloud data, also ensuring integrity. Specifically, aiming at achieving both data integrity and de-duplication in cloud, we propose a system, namely D-cloud. D-cloud introduces an auditing entity with maintenance of the cloud, which helps generate hash value before uploading as well as audit the integrity of data having been stored in cloud. Compared with previous work, the computation by user in D-Cloud is greatly reduced during the file uploading and auditing phases. D-cloud is designed realizing the fact that users always want to encrypt their data being uploaded, and enables integrity auditing and secure de-duplication on encrypted data\r\n', '', 'Mohammed Ahasan Nafis Rizvi', 'Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering,Kharghar', 'hasanrizvi44@gmail.com', '8286853622', 'Vrindavan Dham,C-301,Sector-5,', 'Plot No-5,6,7,8,', 'Navi Mumbai', '400701', 'Maharashtra', 'India', 'GRDJE/V01/I04/0128/1458909978_IEEE-Secure.docx', '{"Title construction of manuscript was good":"Agree","Introduction covers each part of work done area Introduction covers all required thorough":"Agree","Knowledge to understand the topic":"Partial Agree","Material method was given with company detail":"Disagree","All materials were covered which was used in that work":"Disagree","Method was describe in details":"Disagree","Method was describe with quantity of materials used in that work":"Disagree","Result was discussed thoroughly to understand the effect of work":"Disagree","Result was discussed with mathematical model Application":"Disagree","Acknowledgement was described all help which was received during the work":"Partial Agree","I do not have any objection if this work was published in this journal":"Partial Agree","comment":"1.\\tRelated work has no any justification and Relevancy\\r\\n2.\\tAlgorithms suggested here should be implemented (At least one)\\r\\n3.\\tAlignment of paper is not as per the format\\r\\n4.\\tDiagrams used in this paper should be self-designed\\r\\n5.\\tProposed system should be in separate heading (Not to be a part back ground)\\r\\n6.\\tD-Cloud to be explained before related work or in related Work, if included after related work then make it as result.\\r\\n"}', 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', NULL, 6, 'GRDJE/V01/I04/0128/', '1', 1, 0, 0, '2016-03-25 18:16:18', 0, '2016-03-29 11:25:15', 1, 0),

The purpose of built system are designed to supply power to emergency evacuation system and exist passenger when main power supply has fails. Currently power storage methods are used by charging battery during operation. While on other hand, safety measures employ separate setup thanonce required normal operation. The concept of merging two separate ideologies into one, i.e storing power during the routine operation and utilizing the stored power in case of power failure. This can be achieved by storing energy in a battery bank from the normal supply given to elevator for its working. When a power cut is detected ,which is done using a microcontroller by constantly checking the signal reaching to drive the elevator car, the stored power is utilized to make theelevator reach the nearest corresponding floor and open the doors. Hence the need to equip the elevator with separate safety devices can be fulfilled by reuse of energy, thus eliminating the extra efforts and capital required for safety devices.\r\n', '', 'KARISHMA MANE', 'Smt.

Compression can be of two types lossy or lossless. In lossless compression  bits are reduced by identifying and eliminating redundancy. None information is lost in lossless compression and Lossy compression reduces bits by identifying unnecessary or redundant information and removing it. Data compression or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted through network.\r\nCompression is of two types lossy or lossless. Lossless compression is preferred more than lossy for archival purposes and often for medical imaging, technical drawings, video clips, clip art, or comics and cartoon films. Lossy compression method is required especially when used at low bit rates, Lossy methods are especially suitable for natural images such as original photographs in applications where minor loss of accuracy is acceptable to achieve a substantial  Reduction in bit rate. The lossy compression which cannot identify differences may be called visually lossless. Compression is used because it helps reduce \r\n\r\nresource usage, like data storage space or transmission capacity.\r\nCompressed data must be decompressed to use, this extra process thrusts some computational or other costs through decompression method. Data compression is subject to a space–time complexity trade-off. For example, a compression scheme for video may requires expensive hardware for the video to be decompressed fast enough to be viewed as it is being decompressed, and the option to decompress the video in full it may be inconvenient or require additional storage. The design of data compression strategy involves trade-offs among various factors, including the degree of compression, the amount of distortion introduced ,when using lossy data compression and the computational resources required to compress and decompress the data.\r\n', '', 'LAXMI YADAV', 'THEEM COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING,BOISAR', 'ylaxmi565@gmail.com', '7208644028', 'VINOBA BHAVE NAGAR,C-BLOCK,6/5,PIPE ROAD.', 'KURLA (WEST)', 'MUMBAI', '400070', 'MAHARASHTRA', 'India', 'GRDJE/V01/I05/0002/1458983888_publish-Video-Compression.docx', '{"Title construction of manuscript was good":"Partial Agree","Introduction covers each part of work done area Introduction covers all required thorough":"Disagree","Knowledge to understand the topic":"Partial Agree","Material method was given with company detail":"Partial Agree","All materials were covered which was used in that work":"Disagree","Method was describe in details":"Disagree","Method was describe with quantity of materials used in that work":"Partial Agree","Result was discussed thoroughly to understand the effect of work":"Disagree","Result was discussed with mathematical model Application":"Disagree","Acknowledgement was described all help which was received during the work":"Disagree","I do not have any objection if this work was published in this journal":"Disagree","comment":"Paper is rejected because\\r\\n1.

Control signals are used to setup a communication with the broadcast to the neighbors in their respective channels of operation. But in cognitive network the number of channels is potentially large, broadcasting control information over all channels will cause a large delay in setting up the communication. Thus, exchanging control information is a critical issue in cognitive radio networks. This paper deals with selective broadcasting in multi-hop cognitive radio networks in which, control information is transmitted over pre-selected set of channels. We introduce the concept of neighbor graphs and minimal neighbor graphs, to derive the essential set of channels for transmission. It is shown through simulations that selective broadcasting reduces the delay in broadcast the information and it assures the successful transmission of information to all its neighbors.

The complicated flow structures  observed  behind  the  three  dimensional  bodies  are  a manifestation  of  flow  separation.  It  is  of  great  importance  to understand  and  predict  these  features which eventually determine the resultant drag force in the body.  In  spite  of  continuous research  to  understand  three-dimensional  flows,  the  physics  of separation, coupled to the process of laminar to turbulent transition are not yet fully understood. The lack of proper understanding and non-availability of appropriate and accurate models for separated turbulent flow form the stumbling blocks for accurate prediction using CFD tools. Prolate Spheroid is a spheroid in which the polar axis is greater than the (areas close to the Equator) diameter. Prolate spheroids are very long along a line, whereas (like a slightly flattened ball) spheroids are contracted. The prolate spheroid is generated by rotation of an ellipse about the major axis.   Prolate spheroid shaped balls are used in several sports, such as in Rugby, American Football, Canadian Football etc. A few moons of the solar framework are surmised prolate spheroids fit as a fiddle; it is additionally used to portray the state of some nebulae, for example, the Crab Nebula. The most well-known shapes for the rotation of protons and neutrons in a nuclear core are fit as a fiddle of prolate and oblate spheroids, where the polar pivot is thought to be the spin axis. Many simplified models of submarines, underwater vehicles, airships have a shape which can be described as prolate spheroid with different aspect  ratios  (8  :1,  6  :  1  or  3  :  1).Though prolate spheroids are geometrically simple, the flow characteristics are dominated by complex phenomenon like separation and transition. The flow separation from the leeward side of the spheroid rolls up to form  strong  primary  vortex  on  either  side  of  the  spheroid  which reattaches  on  the  plane  of  symmetry.  The  primary  vortex  is accompanied  by  a  secondary  vortex  which  separates  and reattaches close to the wall surface. At zero angle of incidence the flow can be treated as two-dimensional axisymmetric flow, whereas  for  non-zero  angle  of  incidence,  favorable  pressure gradient  is  prevalent  on  the  windward  side  and  adverse  pressure gradient on the leeward side along the flow axis. Circumferentially the pressure gradient changes as we move from the front to the aft region.  Several implementation and analysis have been reported for surface pressure and skin  friction  coefficient,  profiles  of  mean velocity components and  turbulent stresses and also details of the separated region at various angles of attack for Reynolds number Re = 4.5 ×106.', '', 'Rohan Subbaiah M.D', 'M.V.

The main advantages of this cooling system are it consumes very low power, no emission of harmful gas and support for health. The basic principle of the system is free cooling is taking place when the external ambient air entropy is less than the indoor air enthalpy and the cool external air is transferred to the building room directly. The efficiency of the external cool air system in the past years is very low due to  external air velocity .Due to this drawback this system is not popular. But this paper a new model is proposed to increase the efficiency of cooling. In this paper free cooling is achieved by in conjunction with air collector systems and rotary fan systems. The proposed Air conditioning systems either provide supply 100%fresh air using outside air. So this can be use in the cases of hospitals, densely occupied areas such as theatres etc. This system is only effective when the outer temperature is less than inside temperature.', '', 'Jenopaul.

Slope stability radar  is a relatively new  technology and is improving the way mines manage and minimize the risks associated with slope instability, enabling the appropriate precautionary measures to be taken. The SSR remotely scans rock slopes to continuously measure any surface movement and can be used to detect and alert users of wall movements with sub-millimeter precision. The high level of movement precision and broad area coverage of the rock face can allow for a better understanding of the geomechanics of slope deformation, including magnitude of potential failures and additional warning time of impending instability. Radar waves adequately penetrate through rain, dust and smoke to give reliable measurements, 24 hours a day. The precision  is achieved through signal processing by differential interferometry using associated software. Differential interferometry uses the phase information contained in each return pulse and compares it to a previous returning pulse. Measurements of deformation and ground movements can then be deciphered through the differences in the phase information. The radar is equipped with a wireless link which transmits data in real time so that engineers can make immediate decisions without having to be near a potentially unstable slope and the radar is trailer mounted for easy relocation.

The authors, in terms of submitting manuscripts should be aware of the following key terms and guidelines.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">The research work should be creative under the specific domain.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">The keyword should be finite (5-6 words max) and precisely related to your article subject.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">Maximum number of authors (including main and co-authors) should be 5</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">The article should be written using good word processing software(e.g. : MS-Word)</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">The spelling and grammer should be maintained correctly</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">The Author names should be full and in proper manner as per the manuscript templates below</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">The refrences should be correct whenever its necessary. The usage of citation should be mentioned wherever its used</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">The web links are allowed in article. But author should be aware of security and correctness of link.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">After writing manuscript, authors have to submit them manualy by going to article submission page.(<a title="Submit Manuscript" href="../../grdje/submit-an-article">Submit Manuscript</a>).</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">The main author will be notified through e-mail about any further procedures and state of article.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">As soon as the article is reviewed by our reviewers, the author shall receive an email about the acceptance/rejaction of article.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">The author upon acceptance can go for further procedure of publishing an article. If the article is rejected the author wouldn&rsquo;t get their article published. Regarding any confusion about the acceptance/rejaction, authors are free to ask any queries on our contact nos</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;">The publishing procedure requires two more steps by authors 1)payment 2) copyright transfer.

Can be structured or unstructured depending on a journal''s needs. Most types of articles require abstracts.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Accept-</strong>Final decision made by journal. Acceptance means the paper is subsequently sent to production to initiate the publication phase.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Acceptance Mail- </strong>Decision Mail dispatched by editorial to author confirming willingness to publish article. The letter may be accompanied by administrative forms (e.g., copyright agreement/transfer form, color charges, offprint order form, etc.). The letter also states what the author is required to do next (e.g., return proofs in timely fashion).</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Blinded-</strong>A version of the peer-review process that sees the identity of the authors hidden from reviewers. Sometimes this means the editorial office must remove the authors'' names from the manuscript. Other identifying information may also have to be removed, including the institution where the study was undertaken, grant award information, and (for medical journals) clinical trial numbers.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright Agreement/Copyright Transfer Agreement-</strong>Legal document that assigns various rights to use, and re-use, content to a publisher, a journal and authors. Nearly all publications now insist such a form must be signed before publication can occur.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Corresponding Author-</strong>The author designated in the published article as the individual to contact in the event of an inquiry about a manuscript. The corresponding author normally is responsible for correcting page proofs and working with the production editor. Previously, the corresponding author may have fielded requests for article reprints, although this practice has almost disappeared.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Editor-</strong>A generic term that refers to a person/persons who possesses decision making power over the publication or rejection of content. Editors influence content direction and determine the type of material they wish to see published. They may also undertake some manuscript editing.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Editorial Board-</strong>A group of people that supports the Editor-in-Chief, and help shape the editorial direction of a journal. They may serve the journal directly by assigning reviewers to manuscripts&nbsp;or work in a more advisory capacity. The Editor-in-Chief typically calls at least one editorial board meeting annually.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Impact Factor-</strong>A measurement of the citation average of articles published in a journal. Higher citation journals typically are recognized as the most influential journals in a particular field. The size of the score can have a significant impact on the ability for journals to attract a certain quality of papers and authors. It is calculated by taking the number of citations in a calendar year to articles published in the prior two years and divided by the number of articles published in those previous two years. Several thousand journals are awarded an Impact Factor. A new Impact Factor is produced typically in June, and is now the copyright of Thomson Reuters.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Journal-</strong>A collection of papers, published as a periodical, on a particular subject. Journals range in size of circulation and volume of submissions and cover all subjects studied in academic and research settings as well as professional fields.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Manuscript-</strong>A collection of text, tables and graphic files submitted to a journal; the output from a scholarly endeavor.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Open Access-</strong>Ability for anyone to access a manuscript free of charge. Some journals offer Open Access content, with the cost burden covered by the authors. Other journals may offer some content free after a period of time. Some funding bodies (e.g., National Institutes of Health, Welcome Trust) insist that all material must be made freely available.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Open Peer Review-</strong>Ability for any individual to comment on a manuscript and make suggestions to an editor. An alternative to traditional peer review in that it is a collaborative effort rather than the closed process whereby a journal selects the reviewers. Typically authors post a manuscript for open review and then accept feedback and comments, submitting the manuscript officially sometime later</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Peer Review-</strong>Evaluation of a manuscript by individuals with subject expertise. In some instances, peer reviewers know the names of authors. Under a double-blind system the author''s identity is not revealed. Under both processes, the identity of a reviewer is not normally revealed.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Plagiarism-</strong>The act of appropriating someone else s work and passing it off as your own. Journals periodically receive manuscripts containing substantial portions of text that have been copied from a previously published article. Plagiarism represents a very serious ethical offense. Authors can face significant disciplinary action if their plagiarism is uncovered</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Proofreader-</strong>The proofreader is responsible for checking the page proof against the original, copy edited manuscript.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Publication Date-</strong>Date manuscript either appears in print or online. Certain databases, such as GRD Journals&nbsp;now recognize online publication as the date of official publication.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>References-</strong>A section of a manuscript that lists articles cited in the main text of a manuscript.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rejection-</strong>A decision made by a journal not to publish a manuscript. Usually this decision is rendered if the manuscript does not meet the minimum threshold for publication.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title Page-</strong>Listing of: article title; authors and corresponding author contact information. Additionally, some journals may insist that authors also include the following on title pages: running head; conflict of interest statement; funding source declaration, acknowledgement; count of words, tables and figures</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Use of wordprocessing software</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important that the file be saved in the native format of the wordprocessor used. The text should be in single-column format. Keep the layout of the text as simple as possible.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Article structure</strong>&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Manuscripts should be prepared according to APA, 6th ed., except for the additional requirement of numbering the sections, as described below.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Subdivision - numbered sections</strong></em>&nbsp;<br /> Divide your article into clearly defined and numbered sections. Subsections should be numbered 1.1 (then 1.1.1, 1.1.2, ...), 1.2, etc. (the abstract is not included in section numbering). Use this numbering also for internal cross-referencing: do not just refer to ''the text''. Any subsection may be given a brief heading. Each heading should appear on its own separate line.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Introduction</strong></em>&nbsp;<br /> State the objectives of the work and provide an adequate background, avoiding a detailed literature survey or a summary of the results.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Results</strong></em>&nbsp;<br /> Results should be clear and concise.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Discussion</strong></em>&nbsp;<br /> This should explore the significance of the results of the work, not repeat them. Avoid extensive citations and discussion of published literature.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Conclusions</strong></em>&nbsp;<br /> The main conclusions of the study may be presented in a short Conclusions section, which may stand alone or form a subsection of a Discussion or Results and Discussion section.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Appendices</strong></em>&nbsp;<br /> If there is more than one appendix, they should be identified as A, B, etc. Formulae and equations in appendices should be given separate numbering: Eq. (A.1), Eq. (A.2), etc.; in a subsequent appendix, Eq. (B.1) and so on. Similarly for tables and figures: Table A.1; Fig. A.1, etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Essential title page information</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Title.</em></strong>&nbsp;Concise and informative. Titles are often used in information-retrieval systems. Avoid abbreviations and formulae where possible.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Author names and affiliations.</em></strong>&nbsp;Please clearly indicate the given name(s) and family name(s) of each author and check that all names are accurately spelled. Present the authors'' affiliation addresses (where the actual work was done) below the names. Indicate all affiliations with a lower-case superscript letter immediately after the author''s name and in front of the appropriate address. Provide the full postal address of each affiliation, including the country name and, if available, the e-mail address of each author.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Corresponding author.</em></strong>&nbsp;Clearly indicate who will handle correspondence at all stages of refereeing and publication, also post-publication.&nbsp;<strong>Ensure that the e-mail address is given and that contact details are kept up to date by the corresponding author.</strong></li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em>&nbsp;<br /> A concise and factual abstract is required (maximum 150 words). The abstract should state briefly the purpose of the research, the principal results and major conclusions. An abstract is often presented separately from the article, so it must be able to stand alone. For this reason, References should be avoided, but if essential, then cite the author(s) and year(s). Also, non-standard or uncommon abbreviations should be avoided, but if essential they must be defined at their first mention in the abstract itself.</li>\r\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Keywords</strong></em>&nbsp;<br /> Immediately after the abstract, provide a maximum of 5 keywords, using British or American spelling, but not a mixture of these, and avoiding general and plural terms and multiple concepts (avoid, for example, "and", "of"). Be sparing with abbreviations: only abbreviations firmly established in the field may be eligible. These keywords will be used for indexing purposes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abbreviations</strong>&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Define abbreviations that are not standard in this field in a footnote to be placed on the first page of the article. Such abbreviations that are unavoidable in the abstract must be defined at their first mention there, as well as in the footnote. Ensure consistency of abbreviations throughout the article.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tables</strong>&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Please submit tables as editable text and not as images. Tables can be placed either next to the relevant text in the article, or on separate page(s) at the end. Number tables consecutively in accordance with their appearance in the text and place any table notes below the table body. Be sparing in the use of tables and ensure that the data presented in them do not duplicate results described elsewhere in the article. Please avoid using vertical rules.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Citation in text</strong></em>&nbsp;<br /> Please ensure that every reference cited in the text is also present in the reference list (and vice versa). Any references cited in the abstract must be given in full. Unpublished results and personal communications are not recommended in the reference list, but may be mentioned in the text. If these references are included in the reference list they should follow the standard reference style of the journal and should include a substitution of the publication date with either ''Unpublished results'' or ''Personal communication''.

In view of this, extensive research work is taking place world-wide in the area of on-line tool condition monitoring system. Tool wear is the most undesirable characteristic of machining processes as it adversely affects the tool life, which is of foremost importance in metal cutting owing to its direct impact on the surface quality of the machined surface, and its dimensional accuracy, and consequently, the economics of machining operations.Tool wear has negative effects on surface quality, dimensional precision of work piece, and may even cause a harmful effect on safe operation of total machining system. According to the research, about 20% machine downtime is caused by the tool wear.In addition, the cost of cutting tool and tool changing is about 3–12% of the total machining cost and method for on-machine tool progressive monitoring of tool flank wear by processing the turned component. Therefore, methods for cutting tool wearin an over view of the maximum use of cutting tools. With an effective monitoring system, the wear and damages to the machine tool, downtime, lead time and scrapped components can be avoided.

Two different motion planning approaches have been proposed to solve the said problem. In Approach 1, automatic design of a Mamdani-type Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) using a binary-coded Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been considered. On the other hand, a potential field- based motion planner has been developed in the next approach. Since, the robots are agents and all the time competition is not good, a strategic approach has been proposed to solve the conflicts related to coordination among agents. Performance of the developed approaches have been tested through computer simulations. Computational complexity of both the approaches are also compared to see the feasibility of their on-line implementations. It has been observed that proposed coordination strategy along with the developed motion planners are found to generate movement of the robots in a human-like manner.
